abstract = {In this work, the ignition delay time characteristics of C2 – C3 binary blends of gaseous hydrocarbons including ethylene/propane and ethane/propane are studied over a wide range of temperatures (750 – 2000 K), pressures (1 – 135 bar), equivalence ratios (φ = 0.5 – 2.0) and dilutions (75 – 90%). A matrix of experimental conditions is generated using the Taguchi (L9) approach to cover the range of conditions for the validation of a chemical kinetic model. The experimental ignition delay time data are recorded using low- and high-pressure shock tubes and two rapid compression machines (RCM) to include all of the designed conditions. These novel experiments provide a direct validation of the chemical kinetic model, NUIGMech1.1, and its performance is characterized via statistical analysis, with the agreement between experiments and model being within ~ 26.4% over all of the conditions studied, which is comparable with a general absolute uncertainty of the applied facilities (~ 20%). Sensitivity and flux analyses allow for the key reactions controlling the ignition behavior of the blends to be identified. Subsequent analyses are performed to identify those reactions which are important for the pure fuel components and for the blended fuels, and synergistic/antagonistic blending effects are therefore identified over the wide range of conditions. The overall performance of NUIGMech1.1 and the correlations generated are in good agreement with the experimental data.}

ABSTRACT = {The review contains a comparative analysis of studies on the production of hydrogen and syngas based on the processes of partial oxidation of natural gas and other types of gas feedstock. The results presented in the literature show the high potential of non-catalytic autothermal processes of partial oxidation of hydrocarbons for the development of gas chemistry and energetics. The partial oxidation of hydrocarbons makes it possible to overcome such serious shortcomings of traditional syngas production technologies as technological complexity and high energy and capital intensity. The features of non-catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbon gases, the obtained experimental results and the results of kinetic modeling of various options for the implementation of the process, which confirm the adequacy of the kinetic mechanisms used for the analysis, are considered in detail. Examples of industrial implementation of processes based on partial oxidation and proposed alternative options for its organization are considered. Designs of reactors used to ensure stable conversion of rich mixtures of hydrocarbons with an oxidizer are presented. The possibility of obtaining other chemical products by partial oxidation of hydrocarbons is discussed.},

abstract = {Transition to low carbon societies requires advanced catalysis and reaction engineering to pursue green routes for fuels and chemicals production as well as CO2 conversion. This comprehensive review provides a fresh perspective on the dry reforming of methane reaction (DRM) which constitutes a straightforward approach for effective CO2 conversion to added value syngas. The bottleneck for the implementation of this process at industrial scale is the development of highly active and robust heterogeneous catalysts able to overcome the CO2 activation barrier and deliver sufficient amount of the upgrading products at the desired operation conditions. Also, its high energy demand due to the endothermic nature of the reaction imposes extra difficulties. This review critically discusses the recent progresses on catalysts design ranging from traditional metal-supported catalysts to advanced structured and nanostructured systems with promising performance. The main advantages and culprits of the different catalytic systems are introduced aiming to inspire the catalysis community to further refine these formulations towards the development of “supercatalysts” for DRM.  Besides the design of increasingly complex catalyst morphologies as well as other promising alternatives aiming at reducing the energy consumption of the process or tackle deactivation through reactor design are introduced.}

abstract = {A fifth-order implicit Runge–Kutta method and two fourth-order exponential integration methods equipped with Krylov subspace approximations were implemented for the GPU and paired with the analytical chemical kinetic Jacobian software pyJac. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated by integrating thermochemical state data sampled from stochastic partially stirred reactor simulations and compared with the commonly used CPU-based implicit integrator CVODE. We estimated that the implicit Runge–Kutta method running on a single Tesla C2075 GPU is equivalent to CVODE running on 12–38 Intel Xeon E5-4640 v2 CPU cores for integration of a single global integration time step of 10−6s with hydrogen and methane kinetic models. In the stiffest case studied—the methane model with a global integration time step of 10−4s—thread divergence and higher memory traffic significantly decreased GPU performance to the equivalent of CVODE running on approximately three CPU cores. The exponential integration algorithms performed more slowly than the implicit integrators on both the CPU and GPU. Thread divergence and memory traffic were identified as the main limiters of GPU integrator performance, and techniques to mitigate these issues were discussed. Use of a finite-difference Jacobian on the GPU—in place of the analytical Jacobian provided by pyJac—greatly decreased integrator performance due to thread divergence, resulting in maximum slowdowns of 7.11−240.96×; in comparison, the corresponding slowdowns on the CPU were just 1.39−2.61×, underscoring the importance of use of an analytical Jacobian for efficient GPU integration. Finally, future research directions for working towards enabling realistic chemistry in reactive-flow simulations via GPU/SIMT accelerated stiff chemical kinetics integration were identified.}

abstract = {Direct emissions from the cement industry account for 7%–8% of global anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, primarily from thermal decomposition of carbonates (i.e., calcination) during clinker production. Iran ranks among the world's top ten cement producers and is the seventh-largest CO₂ emitter globally. Despite its significant contribution to global emissions, Iran's process-related CO2 emissions (i.e., chemically derived CO2 from calcination) remain underreported in international datasets. This study addresses this gap by analyzing CO₂ emissions from carbonate decomposition in 77 Iranian cement plants from 2013 to 2023, highlighting regional and plant-specific emission factors. Utilizing plant-specific clinker data, the study applied methodologies aligned with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate emission factors and CO2 emissions. The findings show notable geographical variations and a substantial national trend, with emissions rising from 28.75 million tonnes (Mt) in 2016 to 39.33 Mt in 2023. A primary contributor is Iran's high clinker-to-cement ratio, averaging 94.1% in 2023, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable production practices, particularly through the adoption of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) like pozzolans and industrial by-products. To address this, the study recommends a two-pronged policy approach: reducing clinker content in cement by promoting blended alternatives, such as Portland Composite Cement (PCC) and Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC), through regulatory controls and economic incentives. These results emphasize the importance of targeted, data-driven policies for sustainable cement production, offering critical insights for stakeholders and policymakers aiming to align Iran's cement sector with global emissions reduction goals.}

abstract = {The decarbonization of the metals industry is a major challenge for the energy transition. Metals are indeed essential elements in the expansion of renewable energy installations worldwide, but they also represent a relevant source of carbon emissions. Therefore, metals producers need to carefully shift their technologies towards less carbon intensive routes. After ranking all the metals in terms of world production volume and total estimated carbon emissions, the three most relevant ones have been selected: steel, aluminum and chromium. Concentrating the rest of the analysis on them, several production processes are available for implementing the decarbonization step, but none of them is currently capable of overcoming the challenge alone and being compatible with the 1.5 °C trajectory. In this perspective, the main production routes are reviewed and proper combinations of proven or emerging technologies are streamlined with the aim to provide an industrially feasible approach to curb the carbon emissions from the metals industry.}

ABSTRACT = {The use of natural gas in pure or in a blended form with hydrogen and syngas in spark ignition (SI) engines has received much attention in recent years. They have higher diffusion coefficient and laminar flame speed, a small quenching distance and wider flammability limit which compensate the demerits of the lean-burn natural gas combustion. Therefore, a careful examination of the chemical kinetics of combustion of gaseous fuel blends is of great importance. In this paper, performance of the various chemical kinetics mechanisms is compared against experimental data, accumulated for methane-based fuel blends under engine-relevant conditions to find the most appropriate mechanism in engine simulations. Pure methane, methane/syngas, and methane/propane blends are mainly studied at various temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. The ignition delay time and laminar flame speed are used as quantitative metrics to compare the simulation results with the data from experiments. The mechanisms were shown to be mainly consistent with the experimental data of lean and stoichiometric mixtures at high pressures. It was also shown that the GRI-3.0 and 290Rxn mechanisms have high compatibility with the ignition delay times and laminar flame speed at high pressures and lean conditions, and they can be utilized for simulations of SI engine combustion due to their lower computational cost. The results of present research provide an important contribution to the methane-based fuel blends combustion simulation under SI engine-relevant conditions.},

Altogether, 35420 concentration data points in 965 datasets were encoded in 332 XML data files and made available on the ReSpecTh site (https://respecth.hu). The measured species are CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, aC3H4 (allene), pC3H4 (propyne), C3H6 (propene), C3H8, C4H2 (diacetylene), C4H4 (vinylacetylene), C6H6 (benzene), CH2O, CH3OH, C2H5OH, O2, CO, CO2, H2, and H2O. In some shock tube measurements, the concentrations of radicals CH, CH3, and OH were also measured. The diluents were N2, H2O, CO2, Ar and He. The performance of 13 methane combustion mechanisms was analysed based on their capability to reproduce concentration measurements across various experimental types and conditions. A novel consideration of temperature uncertainty was proposed and applied in the performance evaluation of models. The mechanisms Aramco-II-2016, Konnov-2017, NUIG1.1–2021, Glarborg-2018, Caltech-2015, and FFCM-I-2016 were the best-performing mechanisms in ascending order of error. Aramco-II-2016 reproduces the concentrations of flow reactors the best, especially for CH4, O2, CO, CO2, CH3OH, and C2 hydrocarbons. Konnov-2017 is good at predicting concentrations in shock tubes, and FFCM-I-2016 has the overall lowest errors for helium-containing measurements. Local sensitivity analysis based on the Aramco-II-2016 mechanism identified 42 important elementary reactions. Directly measured and theoretically calculated rate coefficients (2316 data points in 176 datasets) were collected for these elementary reactions and compared with those used in the investigated methane combustion mechanisms.}

ABSTRACT = {Methane is an important fuel for gas turbine and gas engine combustion, and the most common fuel in fundamental combustion studies. As Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of combustion becomes increasingly important, so do chemical kinetic mechanisms for methane combustion. Kinetic mechanisms of different complexity exist, and the aim of this study is to review commonly used detailed, reduced, and global mechanisms of importance for CFD of methane combustion. In this review, procedures of relevance to model development are outlined. Simulations of zero and one-dimensional configurations have been performed over a wide range of conditions, including addition of H2, CO2 and H2O, and the results are used in a final recommendation about the use of the different mechanisms. The aim of this review is to put focus on the importance of an informed choice of kinetic mechanism to obtain accurate results at a reasonable computational cost. It is shown that for flame simulations, a reduced mechanism with only 42 irreversible reactions gives excellent agreement with experimental data, using only 5% of the computational time as compared to the widely used GRI-Mech 3.0. The reduced mechanisms are highly suitable for flame simulations, while for ignition they tend to react too slow, giving longer than expected ignition delay time. For combustible mixtures with addition of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or water, the detailed as well as reduced mechanisms generally show as good performance as for the corresponding simulations of pure methane/air mixtures.},

Theoretical methods of obtaining rate parameters are now competitive in accuracy with experiment, particularly for small molecules. Moreover, theoretical methods can deal with conditions that experiments frequently cannot. In addition to increased accuracy, theory has rejuvenated methods and discovered phenomena that were completely unappreciated, or at least underappreciated, in the 20th century. Our primary interest here is in molecular-level issues, i.e. in calculating rate and transport parameters. However, dealing with kinetics models that involve thousands of reactions and hundreds of species is important for practical applications and is relatively new to the 21st century. Theory, in a general sense, and theoretical methods development have a role to play here too. We discuss in this review all these topics in some detail with an emphasis on issues and methods that have emerged in the last 20 years or so. Even so, our review is selective, rather than comprehensive, out of necessity.}

abstract = {A reduced order model (ROM) for the non-catalytic partial oxidation (POX) of natural gas was developed and validated against large-scale numerical and experimental results. The ROM utilizes a network of perfectly stirred reactors, each describing a distinctive reactor zone and corresponding conversion processes. The zone definition is based on the CFD calculation of reactive flow, resulting in a compact, physics-based model that is valid for a broad range of POX reactors. The ROM is capable of predicting global reactor characteristics and flow field pattern within a short period of time, enabling the optimization of reactor geometry and the boundary and operating conditions. Additionally, the ROM can be used to evaluate detailed chemical reactions mechanisms. The ROM is validated against semi-industrial process data, and used to analyze the influence of each reactor zone on the overall species conversion. A new correlation between the fuel slip from the burner to the downstream reactor zones, the steam injection, and the λ value is built.}

abstract = {The non-catalytic reforming of natural gas to syngas was studied with test runs at the semi-industrial scale test plant HP POX. The product gas composition, and gas and wall temperatures across the reactor were considered at 50, 60 and 70bar(g), while the reactor temperature was varied between 1200 and 1400°C. In addition, the flame structure was studied using optical measurements. The experiment was designed to provide a challenging benchmark for numerical modeling. For that reason, the reactor geometry, boundary conditions, and the experimental data are provided in such a way that the results can easily be reproduced using CFD.}
